The NASA Space Apps Challenge pairs absurdly ambitious briefs with impossibly short timelines. Our team picked a problem statement that asked for real-time rerouting of humanitarian aid convoys—complete with crowd-sourced signals and satellite imagery. Easy, right?

## The preflight checklist

We scoped ruthlessly:

- **Single core workflow.** One operator enters convoy details, the system generates a prioritized route.
- **Data sources.** Satellite tiles for terrain + community reports to mark unsafe regions.
- **Success metric.** Could we outrun the baseline route by at least 15%?

## Architecture in 12 sticky notes

```text
Client (Next.js) ➜ API (FastAPI) ➜ Worker (Go) ➜ Redis Streams ➜ Mapbox Tiles
```

- **Next.js dashboard** handled data entry and visual overlays.
- **FastAPI** orchestrated inputs, validated constraints, and dispatched work to the Go worker.
- **Go worker** ran the heuristic search (A* with penalties for risky edges).
- **Redis Streams** glued everything together with pub/sub semantics.

## Shipping under pressure

Three lessons made the sprint feel less like chaos and more like choreography:

1. **Sketch the unhappy path first.** What happens when telemetry is stale? We added safeguards before writing feature code.
2. **Choose boring tech.** We re-used libraries we’d already shipped to production (FastAPI, Go, Redis). Zero new dependencies meant zero surprises.
3. **Narrate the journey.** Every teammate wrote mini-log entries ("12:30 UTC — reroute algorithm prefers scenic detour. Investigating.") which fed into our final presentation.

## Did it work?

We beat the baseline ETA by **22%**, surfaced high-risk zones visually, and impressed the judges enough to earn a global nomination. More importantly, we built a shared rhythm for tackling complex problems quickly.

If you ever want to jam on hackathon strategy—or need a partner for your next sprint—drop a line. I promise to bring the sticky notes.
