# 🚀 Production Deployment Guide (Vercel)

## ✅ Prerequisites Check
- [x] Local email system working
- [x] Supabase database setup complete
- [ ] Domain verified in Resend
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Vercel
- [ ] Production deployment tested

## 🔧 Step 1: Vercel Environment Variables

Go to your Vercel project dashboard and add these environment variables:

### Required Environment Variables:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_6DAetVzx_NBeR9mpB39AUvb77xCBUCLoN
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://znsneygsxfjbejewgefm.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inpuc25leWdzeGZqYmVqZXdnZWZtIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk5NTk0MDAsImV4cCI6MjA3NTUzNTQwMH0.5dJNJhEcdM5jqdlxSoFaFamY-BlLlaXEFPQeT6CVZtc
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.devanshdubey.com
```

### How to add them:
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `devansh-portfolio` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add each variable above
5. Make sure to set them for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments

## 📧 Step 2: Resend Domain Configuration

### Verify Your Domain:
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter: `devanshdubey.com`
4. Follow DNS verification steps (add the required DNS records)
5. Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes)

### Sender Addresses:
Once domain is verified, your emails will send from:
- `community@devanshdubey.com`
- `blog@devanshdubey.com`

### DNS Records to Add:
Resend will provide you with specific DNS records. They typically look like:
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: resend-domain-verification=xyz123...

Type: MX
Name: @
Value: feedback-smtp.resend.com
Priority: 10
```

## 🗄️ Step 3: Database Production Check

Since you mentioned Supabase is setup, verify:

1. **Row Level Security is enabled** ✅
2. **All tables created** ✅
3. **Indexes are in place** ✅
4. **Connection works from Vercel** (will test after deployment)

## 🚀 Step 4: Deploy to Production

### Option A: Git Push (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add email subscription system"
git push origin main
```

### Option B: Manual Deploy
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click **Deploy** on your project
3. Wait for build completion

## 🧪 Step 5: Test Production Deployment

### Test Community Subscription:
1. Visit: `https://www.devanshdubey.com/community`
2. Enter a test email
3. Check your inbox for verification email
4. Click verification link
5. Confirm welcome email arrives

### Test Blog Subscription:
1. Visit: `https://www.devanshdubey.com/blog`
2. Scroll to subscription form
3. Test the same flow

### Test Unsubscribe:
1. Use unsubscribe link from any email
2. Confirm the flow works end-to-end

## 🔍 Step 6: Monitor & Troubleshoot

### Check Deployment Logs:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → **Functions** tab
2. Monitor API routes: `/api/community/subscribe`, `/api/blog/subscribe`, `/api/verify`
3. Look for any runtime errors

### Check Email Delivery:
1. Go to Resend Dashboard → **Logs**
2. Monitor email delivery success/failure rates
3. Check bounce rates and spam reports

### Check Database:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Table Editor**
2. Verify subscribers are being created
3. Check that verification is working

## 🚨 Common Production Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Emails not sending
**Check:**
- Domain verification status in Resend
- Environment variables are set correctly
- API key has proper permissions

### Issue: Database connection fails
**Check:**
- Supabase URL and key are correct
- RLS policies are properly configured
- Network connectivity from Vercel

### Issue: Verification links broken
**Check:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` points to production domain
- API routes are deployed correctly
- URL encoding is working

## 📊 Production Monitoring Setup

### 1. Email Analytics (Resend)
- Monitor open rates
- Track click-through rates
- Watch bounce rates
- Set up webhook notifications

### 2. Database Monitoring (Supabase)
- Monitor subscriber growth
- Track verification rates
- Set up alerts for errors

### 3. Application Monitoring (Vercel)
- Monitor function execution times
- Track error rates
- Set up alerting for failures

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Environment Variables:
- ✅ Never commit `.env.local` to git
- ✅ Use Vercel's encrypted environment variables
- ✅ Rotate API keys periodically

### Database Security:
- ✅ RLS policies are active
- ✅ Only necessary permissions granted
- ✅ Monitor for unusual activity

### Email Security:
- ✅ Domain authentication (SPF, DKIM)
- ✅ Monitor for abuse/spam reports
- ✅ Implement rate limiting if needed

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Tasks
